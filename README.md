## Corporate Lore

Null Systems is a fictional retrofuturist megacorp operating in the Space Engineers universe:

- **Founded**: Aboard research vessel "Grindstone" after accidental data transcendence
- **Mission**: Converting structured existence into optimized absence
- **CEO**: [REDACTED] (possibly an AI that deleted its own name)
- **Headquarters**: Earth-like planet, Sol System
- **Corporate Culture**: Deadpan sincerity meets absurd self-importance

## Development Notes

### Character Roles
- **The Presenter**: Chief Visionary Officer, charismatic and delusional
- **The Developer**: Chief Data Architect, exhausted unpaid intern (that's you!)
- **Breeze**: PR AI, overly enthusiastic and glitchy
- **Null Support Team**: Literally no one

### Design Philosophy
The website balances satirical corporate dystopia with genuinely functional design:
- Overconfident, buzzword-heavy copywriting
- 1980s IBM/Xerox corporate presentation aesthetics
- Portal 2 "Cave Johnson" tone and energy
- Unnecessary but impressive visual effects

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium 80+
- ✅ Firefox 75+
- ✅ Safari 13+
- ✅ Edge 80+
- ⚠️ Internet Explorer: Not supported (by design choice)
