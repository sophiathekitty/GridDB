## Technical Notes

### File Naming Convention
- Use exact filenames as listed above
- All lowercase with hyphens for spaces
- Save in `/website/assets/images/` folder

### Optimization
- Compress images for web use while maintaining quality
- Consider WebP format for better compression
- Ensure images look good on both light and dark backgrounds

### Placeholder Strategy
If certain shots are difficult to create, temporary placeholder images can be used initially:
- Solid colored rectangles with text describing the intended image
- Space Engineers default screenshots with appropriate overlays
- Abstract geometric patterns that fit the aesthetic

## Creative Direction Notes

Remember that Null Systems is supposed to be a "retrofuturist megacorp" with a "80s corporate optimism meets vaporwave dystopia" aesthetic. All images should:

- Feel slightly over-the-top and self-important
- Have that "corporate presentation" polish
- Include lots of blue/cyan lighting and dark backgrounds
- Look like they could be from a 1980s vision of the future
- Maintain the absurd sincerity of the corporate messaging

The goal is to create images that support the satirical corporate dystopia narrative while still looking genuinely impressive and professional.
